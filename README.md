# Structural neuroimaging biomarkers for obsessive-compulsive disorder

This repo contains the impentation of the paper "Structural neuroimaging biomarkers for obsessive-compulsive disorder in the ENIGMA-OCD consortium: medication matters".  Published in Translational Psychiatry. 2020 Oct 8;10(1):342. doi: 10.1038/s41398-020-01013-y.

Here, we aimed to identify magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers for OCD, using 46 data sets with 2304 OCD patients and 2068 healthy controls from the ENIGMA consortium. We performed machine learning analysis of regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume and tested classification performance using cross-validation.
